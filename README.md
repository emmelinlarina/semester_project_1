# Explorium Science Museum

#### Semester Project 1

A colorful and simple responsive website built as my **Semester Project 1** at Noroff.
The target audience is **children (7-15)** and families, with the goal of making a fun, inviting, and accessible site to inspire visits to the museum.

## About the Project

The website was designed to:
. Be **clean, simple, and playful** with vivid CTAs and fun shapes.

- Use **responsive design** to adapt across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- Be accessible (WCAG-checked colors and semantic HTML).
- Give me hands-on practice with \*_HTML_ and _CSS_, focusing on structure and responsiveness.

The project consist of **4 pages**:

1. Homepage (Explore with us)
2. Exhibitions (Events and details)
3. Contact page with a form
4. Contribution page (Support us)
